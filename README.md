# GMJS
<p>
GM.JS is a very simple game creation wrapper.<br>
"Game Maker JS"<br>
This javascript wrapper is used for creating simple games on-the-fly.<br>
Note: In using this wrapper, you fully acknowledge that there are known performance limitations, and is not recommended for professional use!

Requirements:<br>
pixi.js*<br>
pixi-sound*<br>
nimble.js*<br>
*Included in repository
</p>
<br>
<p>Due to the nature of PIXI's resource loader, you must host the files on a mini-webserver in order to play the game.</p>
<p>I did not make any of the included requirements. These files are required for the GMJS wrapper to function properly.</p>
<br>

<p>
Read the included example index.html file for help.

There is currently no documentation on how to use this. Please bear with its beginning development stages.
